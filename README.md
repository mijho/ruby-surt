# ruby-surt

## Overview

A ruby gem to parse URL's into SURT format. The functionality to generate the SURT is basic but works, full URL canonicalisation for Web Archiving would be needed to build this out fully.

I'm using this as a project to re-remember ruby but may build out the canonicalisation fully. I'll update the README here when I consider it feature complete.
